..................................River and Land Minor Project overview............................................


Algorithm:

1) for each element(only if it is river) we will check top and left 
if there is any adjacent river(horizontal + vertical):
    we will update the current element by adding the adjacent river i.e current river = current river + adjacent river 
    and then update adjacent river to 0
2) in above step after traversing all elements or array, now again traverse the whole array and look for non zero elements
and append those to list which will be the final answer
