..................................River and Land Minor Project overview............................................

read_csv.py :This programm is used for processing the csv file and it returns  the Name and Email of all the entries.


authenticate_data.py : This programm is an extention of the above programm which process the data and stores it further in a 
dictionary."DictReader" module from csv helps us by printing the data in a dictionary format and we use dictionary 
comprehension and for loop to get the final result.


game_functionality.py: This programm takes user input to create a user defined matrix ,it computes the river length using a 
predefined logic and  further descides if the user was a winner or he lost based on his guess.


Algorithm:

1) for each element(only if it is river) we will check top and left elements if it is river or land.
   If there is any adjacent river(horizontal+ vertical):
    we will update the current element by adding the adjacent river i.e current river = current river + adjacent river 
    and then update adjacent river to 0
2) In the above step after traversing all elements or array, we will again traverse the whole array and look for non zero elements
and append those to the list which will be the final guess(river length)
